 * 
 * @param[in]       lookfrom Camera position
 * @param[in]       lookat point towards coordinate
 * @param[in]       vup the vector representing the normal to the camera plane. Can be specified to rotate the camera.
 * @param[in]       vfov Field of view
 * @param[in]       aspect_ratio float of width/height
 * @param[in]       focus_dist Distance from lookfrom in direction towards lookat to focus on. e.g 10.0 means the distance of highest sharpness is 10 units in direction of pointing.
 * 
 * @note Shutter open and shutter close are defaulted to 0 and 1, and have no effect on anything.
